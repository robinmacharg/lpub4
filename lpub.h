 *
 *  Program structure, organization and file naming conventions.
 *
 *    LPub is conceptually written in layers.  The lower level layers
 *  interact with the real LDraw files, and the highest layers interact
 *  with Qt, and therefore the computer system, its mouse, keyboard,
 *  graphics display and file system.
 *
 *  Fundamental concept files:
 *    lpub.(h,cpp) - the application (outermost) layer of code.  When
 *      LPub first starts up, this outer layer of code is in charge.
 *      main.cpp is the actual start of program, but that simply 
 *      creates and destroys an implementation of LPub's application
 *      defined in lpub.(h,cpp)
 *  
 *    ldrawfiles(h,cpp) - knows how to read and write MPD files and 
 *      retain the contents in a list of files.  For non-MPD files, 
 *      this layer reads in top level file, and any submodel files 
 *      that can be found in the same directory as the top level file. 
 *      After being loaded, the rest of LPub does not care if the 
 *      model came from MPD or not.  The rest of LPub only interacts
 *      with the model through this layer of code.
 *
 *    partslist(h,cpp) - internalizes part headers from PARTS.LST from
 *      the LDraw installation.  All transations from part type to header
 *      go through this layer.
 *
 *    color(h,cpp) - knows about LDraw color numbers and their RGB values.
 *
 *    paths(h,cpp) - a place to put the names of external dependencies like
 *      the path for the LDraw file system, the path to ldglite, etc.
 *
 *    render(h,cpp) - provides access to the renderer which means either
 *      LDGLite or LDView. You can set your preferred renderer. (red. Jaco)
 *
 *  The next layer has to do with the parsing of the LDraw files and knowing
 *  what to do with them.  At the lowest level, LPub's parsing is line based
 *  as specified in the LDraw file specification.  At the higher layers, the
 *  recognition of the meaning of the lines implies how LPub should respond to
 *  them.  LDraw type 1 through 5 lines are obviously model content and eventually
 *  get fed to the renderer.  LDraw type 0 lines provide meta-commands like STEP.
 *  LPub specific meta-commands come in two flavors:  configuration metas, and
 *  action metas.  configuration metas values are retained, and action metas
 *  potentially use the values from configuration metas to do their jobs.
 *
 *  This and higher layers are built around some fundamental concepts
 *  provided by LPub. These include:
 *    Step - literally, this means the LDraw defined STEP metacommand.
 *           It also means an MLCad ROTSTEP metacommand.  For LPub it means
 *           one or more LDraw type 1 through type 5 lines (part, line,
 *           triangle, and quads) followed by STEP, ROTSTEP or end of file
 *           (an implied step).  Empty STEPs: ones not preceded by the addition
 *           of type 1 through type 5 lines are ignored.
 *           For LPub, conceptually step means something that needs to
 *           be displayed in your building instructions:
 *              - a step number
 *              - the model after all previous type1 through 5 lines 
 *                are added together
 *              - any of the type1 lines since the previous step (e.g. "in
 *                this step"), that are submodels.  These are either
 *                called out (see callout below), or represent one or more
 *                building instruction pages.
 *              - the list of part type/colors for parts list images
 *   MultiStep - a collection of steps in the current model/submodel.
 *          These steps are displayed in rows (horizontally), or columns
 *          vertically.  A multi-step can contain multiple rows or columns.
 *   Callout - a collection of all the steps in a submodel, being displayed
 *          on the current page.  These steps are displayed in rows or columns.
 *          A callout can contain multiple rows or columns.
 *   Pointer - a visual indicator starting at a callout, and ending at the
 *          assembly image to which the callout belongs.
 *   ranges.h - the interal representation for both multi-steps and callouts.
 *          A ranges is a list of one or more individual range(s).
 *   Range - one row or column in a multi-step or callout. A range contains
 *          one or more steps.
 *   Step again - a step can contain one or more callouts.  Callouts contain
 *          one or more ranges, which contain one or more range-s, which
 *          contain one or more steps.  Callouts in callouts in callouts
 *          can happen, and LPub has to deal with it.
 *
 *   LPub is page oriented.  As it walks through your LDraw file creating
 *   building instructions, it reads and internalizes a page worth of the
 *   lines in your model.  It keeps what is needed to draw the page in a
 *   tree of data structures.  A page has a page number, one or more
 *   assembly step images, possibly a parts list image, zero or more
 *   callouts, with zero or more pointers.
 *
 *   Once LPub recognizes a page boundary (end of multistep, STEP or 
 *   end of file (implied step), it converts the tree for that
 *   page into graphical representations and displays them so the user
 *   can interact with them.
 *
 *   The cornerstone of this page oriented process is line by line parsing
 *   and recognition of the lines in your ldraw file.  There are two functions
 *   that do this parsing.  findPage traverses the model higherarchy, counting
 *   pages.  One issue is that you do not know the page number at start of
 *   step, because non-callout submodels result in pages.  findPage is lightweight
 *   mechanism for scanning through the design, and finding the page of interest.
 *   at each page boundary, if the current page number is not the desired page
 *   and the current page is before the desired page, the state of the parse is
 *   saved.  When we hit the page we want to display, the saved state is passed
 *   to drawPage.  drawPage ignores any non-callout submodels (those were taken
 *   care of by findPage) gathers up any callouts, and at end of page, converts
 *   the results to Qt GraphicsItems.  After drawPage draws the page, it returns
 *   to findPage, which traverses the rest of the model hierarchy counting the
 *   total number of pages.
 *
 *   findPage and drawPage present a bit of a maintainability dilema, because
 *   for a few things, there is redundnant code.  This is small, though, and
 *   having findPage as a separate function, makes optimizations there easier.
 *
 *   findPage and drawPage know about all LDraw line types and deals with 
 *   types 1 through 5 directly.  They depends on a whole set of classes to 
 *   parse and possibly retain information from meta-commands (type 0 lines).  
 *   findPage and drawPage both deal with "0 GHOST" meta-commands themselves, 
 *   but all other metacommand parsing is done by the Meta class and its 
 *   associated meta subclasses.
 *
 *   findPage and drawPage's interface to the Meta class is through the 
 *   parse function.  meta.parse() is handed an ldraw type 0 line, and the
 *   file and lineNumber that the line came from.  For configuration meta-commands
 *   the meta classes retain the filename/linenumber information for use
 *   in implementing backannotation of user changes into the LDraw files.
 *   meta.parse() provides a return code indicating what it saw.  Some 
 *   meta-commands (like LDraw's STEP, MLCad's ROTSTEP, and LPub's CALLOUT BEGIN) 
 *   are action meta-commands.  Each action meta-command has its own specific
 *   return code.  Configuration meta-commands provide a return code that
 *   says the line parsed ok, or failed parsing.
 *
 *   Meta is composed of other classes, and is described and implemented
 *   in meta.(h,cpp).  Some of those classes are LPubMeta (which is composed
 *   of a whole bunch of other classes), and MLCadMeta (which is also composed
 *   of other classes.
 *
 *   The LPubMeta class is composed of major lpub concepts like, page (PageMeta),
 *   callout (CalloutMeta), multi-step (MultiStepMeta), and parts list (PliMeta).
 *   These are all composed of lower level classes.  There are mid-layer
 *   abstractions like the concept of a number which has font, color
 *   and margins, or LPub concepts like placement, background, border, and
 *   divider (the visual thing that sits between rows or columns of steps).
 * 
 *   Then there are the bottom layer classes like, an integer
 *   number, a floating point number, a pair of floating point numbers, units,
 *   booleans, etc.  Units are like floating points, except their internal
 *   values can be converted to pixels (which is the cornerstone concept of
 *   supporting dots per inch or dots per centimeter.  
 * 
 *   These are all derived from an abstract class called LeafMeta. Leaf
 *   metas provide the handling of the "rest of the meta-command", typically
 *   parsing the actual values of a specific configuration meta-command, or
 *   returning a special return code for action meta-commands.  Every leaf
 *   has the knowledge of where it was defined in your LDraw model (modelName,
 *   lineNumber).  See the Where class in where.(h,cpp).  The
 *   Where information (filename, linenumber) is used to implement backannotation
 *   of user changes into the LDraw files.
 *
 *   All metas that are not derived from LeafMeta are derived from
 *   BranchMeta.  A BranchMeta represent non-terminal nodes in the meta-command
 *   syntax graph.  A BranchMeta contains a list of keywords, each of which
 *   is associated with an instance of a meta that handles that keyword.
 *   The list of keyword/metas can contain either Leaf or Branch Metas,
 *   both of which are derived from AbstractMeta.
 *
 *   So, in the big picture Meta contains all the values associated with all
 *   possible meta-commands, or if not specified, their default values.
 *   Meta is handed around to various layers of the process for converting
 *   the page's contents to graphical entities.
 *
 *   When findPage hits end of page, for the page being displayed, it returns
 *   a tree of the page's contents, and the configuration information (Meta)
 *   to its caller.
 *
 *   There are only a few callers of findPage, the most important being
 *   drawPage (not the detailed one findPage calls, but a highlevel one
 *   that takes no parameters.  Draw page converts the LDraw file structure 
 *   tree (ranges, range, step) and the configuration tree (Meta) into 
 *   graphical entities. drawPage is a member of LPub (therefore lpub.h, 
 *   and implemented in traverse.cpp.
 *
 *   The LDraw structure tree is composed of classes including:
 *     ranges.h  - ranges.(h,cpp), ranges_element.(h,cpp)
 *       By itself, ranges.h represents multi-step.  Single step per page
 *       is represented by ranges.h that contains one range, that contains
 *       one step.  ranges.h is the top of structure tree provided by
 *       traverse.
 *     Range   - range.(h,cpp), range_element.(h,cpp)
 *     Step    - step.(h,cpp)
 *     Callout - callout.(h,cpp)
 *     Pli     - pli.(h,cpp)
 *
 *   These classes all represent things visible to the reader of your
 *   building instructions.  They each have to be placed on the page.
 *   They are all derived from the Placement class, which describes
 *   what they are placed next to, and how they are placed relative
 *   to that thing.  See placement.(h,cpp).
 *
 *   Each of these items (ranges.h, Range, Step, Callout, Pli, etc.)
 *   knows how to size itself (in pixels).  Once sizes are known, these
 *   things can be placed relative to the things they are relative to.
 *   At the top level, one or more things are placed relative to the page.
 *
 *   Once placed, graphical representations of these things are created.
 *   In particular, they are converted to graphical "items", added to
 *   the page's "scene", which is displayed in a "view" which is in
 *   a big window in the LPub application.  The items/scene/view concepts
 *   are defined by Qt and are very powerful abstactions.  LPub's
 *   "scene" components are implemented in files name *item.(h,cpp)
 *
 *     csiitem(h,cpp) an assembly image
 *     ranges_item(h,cpp)
 *     numberitem.(h,cpp)
 *     calloutbackgrounditem.(h,cpp)
 *     pointeritem.(h,cpp)
 *     backgrounditem.(h,cpp)
 *     
 *   In the case of PLIs, the "item" implementation is in pli.(h,cpp)
 *
 *   Once the page components are sized, placed and put into the scene,
 *   Qt displays the view to the user for editing.  The various graphical
 *   "items" can have menus, and can handle mouse activity, like press,
 *   move, and release.  Each of these activities is translated into
 *   an event, which is handed to the associated item.
 *
 *   Events typically imply a user change to the LDraw files.  The file
 *   metaitem.(h,cpp) provides methods for backannotating this editing
 *   activity to the LDraw files.  Some of these events imply the need
 *   for a user to change some configuration.  Configuration is maintained
 *   in Meta's, thus the name meta-item.  Meta's not only retain the values
 *   for configuration, but what file/line last set the current value.
 *
 *   Certain of these metas' values are changed via graphical dialogs. These
 *   dialogs contain push buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, and such
 *   that let the user change values.  Some dialogs use Qt dialogs like,
 *   font or color.  After the user changes some value(s) and hits OK,
 *   The values are backannotated into the LDraw file.  At this point
 *   LPub invokes traverse to count pages, gathers up the content of the
 *   current page, produces a new scene that is displayed for the user.
 *
 *   The graphical representations for configuration metas are implemented
 *   in metagui.(h,cpp).  Each of these is used in at least two ways:
 *     Global - values that are specified before the first step of the
 *       entire model (think of them as defaults).
 *       projectglobals.cpp
 *       pageglobals.cpp
 *       multistepglobals.cpp
 *       assemglobals.cpp
 *       pliglobals.cpp
 *       calloutglobals.cpp
 *     Local - values that are specified in something other than the first
 *       global step and are invoked individually in small dialogs
 *       backgrounddialog.(h,cpp)
 *       borderdialog.(h,cpp)
 *       dividerdialog.(h,cpp)
 *       placementdialog.(h,cpp)
 *       pairdialog.(h,cpp) - single integer, floating point
 *                            pair of floating point
 *       scaledialog.(h,cpp) - single and pair dialogs for values retained
 *                             in either inches or centimeters.  Quite
 *                             possibly this could be combined with pairdialog
 *                             and eliminated.
 *
 *   placementdialog lets the user access LPub's placement concept of
 *   things placed relative to things with margins in between.
 *
 *   The can also use the mouse to drag things around on the page, to change
 *   placement.  The implementations of these movements and their backannotation
 *   into the ldraw files are implemented in *item.cpp
 *
 *   This only leaves a few source files undescribed.  Part of the 
 *   LPub gui presented to the user is a texual display of the LDraw
 *   file.  It is displayed using editwindow.(h,cpp) using a Qt QTextEdit
 *   object.  The syntax highlighing that goes with that is implemented
 *   in highlighter.(h,cpp).
 *
 *   Like gui edits, the manual edits in the editWindow have to be
 *   back annotated into the ldraw files.  It is important to note that
 *   the text displayed in editWindow is only a copy of what is in ldrawFiles.
 *   User changes in these files cause an event that tells you position
 *   (i.e. how many characters from start of file), number of characters
 *   added, and number of characters deleted.  It annoyingly does not
 *   tell you the actual characters added or the characters deleted, just
 *   position and how many.
 *
 *   editWindow extracts the contents of textEdit and picks out the new
 *   characters that were added.  It then signals Gui that at this position
 *   (in the file you told me to display), this many characters were deleted,
 *   and these characters were added.
 *
 *   The Gui code examines the ldrawFiles version of the file being displayed
 *   by the editWindow, and calculates the characters that were deleted.
 *   With position, characters added and characters deleted, we can perform
 *   the edit, and undo it.
 *
 *   Most of the user activity maps to changes of the LDraw file(s).  All these
 *   changes are funneled through Qt's undo/redo facility.  So, new meta
 *   commands are inserted into the LDraw file, changes to an existing meta
 *   are replaced in the LDraw file, and removal of metas (think undo),
 *   means lines are deleted in the LDraw file(s).
 *
 *   Each of these activities is implemented as a Qt command, which works
 *   in conjuction with the undo redo facility.  These commands are
 *   implemented in commands.(h,cpp).
 *
 *   This leaves only a few miscellanous files unexplained.  commonmenis.(h,cpp)
 *   could just as easily been named metamenus.(h.cpp).  These implement
 *   popup menu elements (and their help information) for commonly used
 *   meta commands.
 *
 *   resolution.(h,cpp) contain some variables that define the resolution
 *   (e.g. 72) per units (inches vs. centimeters).  Most of the resolution
 *   dependence is implemented in meta.(h,cpp), but a few other situations
 *   require the knowledge of resolution.
